## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Correct linking of .html and .pdf files:


* [Correct Example 1](https://bu-ie-360.github.io/spring24-abdullahkayacan-boun/IE360_Spring24_Syllabus.pdf): The .pdf file is in the same location with your index file.
* [Correct Example 2](https://bu-ie-360.github.io/spring24-abdullahkayacan-boun/files/R_Markdown_Example_in_RStudio.html): The .html file is in a folder called files and this folder is in the same location with your index file.

* [Correct Example 3](IE360_Spring24_Syllabus.pdf): You can use the path and the file name only.

* [Correct Example 4](files/How%20to%20export%20your%20work%20as%20an%20HTML%20file.pdf): You can use the path and the file name only.

* [Wrong Example](https://github.com/BU-IE-360/spring24-abdullahkayacan-boun/blob/main/IE360_Spring24_Syllabus.pdf): Do not provide links with "blob" or "main". Be careful with this issue while linking your Homework Assignments.


### Example scripts and .html files
* [R Markdown Example HTML in Rstudio](files/R_Markdown_Example_in_RStudio.html): The .pdf file is in a folder called files.
* [Jupyter Notebook Example HTML](files/python_example_in_Jupyter_Notebook.html): The .pdf file is in a folder called files.
* [R Markdown Example Script](https://github.com/BU-IE-360/spring24-abdullahkayacan-boun/blob/main/files/R_Markdown_Example_in_RStudio.Rmd): .Rmd script is in a folder called files.
* [Python Example Script](https://github.com/BU-IE-360/spring24-abdullahkayacan-boun/blob/main/files/python_example_in_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb): .ipynb script is in a folder called files.

You don't need to link your source codes unless asked. Your code should be visible in your .html files already.
